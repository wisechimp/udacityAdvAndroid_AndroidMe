# Android_Me
App that lets you style your own Android! This uses Fragments to create a flexible and responsive UI which can be deployed on phones and tablets.

This is a exercise repository for the AndroidMe example app which is part of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).

Project has been updated by adding a RecyclerView in place of the GridView used in the course.
